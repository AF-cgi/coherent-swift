![Cohesion](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Farthurpalves%2Fcoherent-swift%2Fbadge%2Freports%2Fcoherent-badge.json)

Now you can proudly show a cohesion badge on the README of your project, as the one above.
`coherent-swift` generates a  `coherent-badge.json` inside your report folder, which is compatible with [shields.io](www.shields.io).

Use [shields.io](www.shields.io) endpoint to generate a badge based on the JSON file, all you need to do is provide the URL of the json file generated in the format below:
```
https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={url_to_your_project/master/reports/coherent-badge.json}
```
